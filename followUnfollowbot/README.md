#FollowUnfollowBot

You give the bot a bunch of Twitter accounts whose followers you think might be interested to follow you (e.g. you own a twitter account where you tweet about JavaScript: give your bot a bunch of popular twitter accounts which tweet about JavaScript - this way you will often follow random people who might be interested in this topic - who might end up following you too!).

The bot will be picking randomly these accounts you specified and start following their followers. It will also pick random users from your friend list (the people you are following) and will check if they follow you back - if they are not then the bot will automatically unfollow those users.

You can also tell the bot not to unfollow certain accounts - which you consider interesting following although they are not following you back.
