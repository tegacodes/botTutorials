Node twitter bot examples

Twitter examples for the Social Software elective at SUNY Purchase 2015.

##Yo Yo Listen Up

Twitter does not recognize artificial intelligences and a legitimate use of its service. Things that will get you banned:

only replying to people, never writing your own stuff
writing the same thing over and over, or very similar variants of stuff

Your account will be banned, so make sure to use alt accounts.

So I would recommend doing something interesting with the data, over making something that is chatty. Bots that do status updates are ok.

The twitter API also has rate limits as outlined here.
